					<h1>Ashley Alyssa R. Gacutan</h1>
					<p>Ms. Ashley Gacutan decided to build an airline, because when she was 6 years old she wants to become a flight attendant. But when her dream to become a flight attendant was not continued she decided to have an airline instead. She first worked as a sea woman so that she can save money in building her own airline. When the time came that she already earned and saved some money to use for her desired airline she left her job and started planning for her airline.</p>
